what happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates the meta data for git to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area are for files to be identified or grouped to identify a logical change. Once the subset is put in staging area and stable then they can be all put together into a repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

This is mainly discipine. Only add files to staging area that belong to a single feature or bug fix.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Perhaps each new feature should be on a branch and get merged in. This would make the log of changes easier to follow.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Helps to see where a branch started to understand.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

All of the commits get rolled together in commit time order. It uses a simple merge algorithm to decide which changes to keep.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs always doing merges manually?

Clearly it would take a crystal ball and an incredible algorithm to figure out the correct resolution of conflicts between developers. It is much simpler to flag code.
